# Projects
This folder is designted for Data Analytics/Data Science Projects I've completed through online courses and personal practice.

I have a robust understanding of data analysis and visualization in R, honed through hands-on experience. My competencies include data manipulation using dplyr where I've filtered, aggregated, sorted, and mutated dataframes. I've also executed advanced data analysis, deriving descriptive statistics and conducting condition-based operations. 

My expertise in ggplot2 allows me to craft detailed visual representations, from basic plots to customized visuals using varied scales and geometric objects. Additionally, I'm adept at data importation, especially with the dslabs package, and have a keen eye for inspecting and understanding dataset structures. 

I utilize the tidyverse pipelining for seamless operations chaining and have experience managing missing data points. I've worked extensively with datasets like heights, murders, and us_contagious_diseases. 

My foundational skills in R include a deep understanding of data types, structures, and the ability to set global parameters for enhanced data presentation.
